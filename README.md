## 📊 Models

The following models are trained and evaluated in this project:

---

### Logistic Regression

*The confusion matrix provides a summary of the prediction results on the classification problem. It shows the number of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions.*



## 🎯 Performance Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

### Logistic Regression

- **Accuracy (Doğruluk):** %78.57
- **Precision (Kesinlik):** %88.89
- **Recall (Duyarlılık):** %81.63
- **F1 Score:** %85.29
- **ROC AUC:** %83.86

**Confusion Matrix:**

##### Explanations:

1. [x] **_Accuracy:_** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
2. [x] **_Precision:**_ The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
3. [x] **_Recall:_** The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives. It measures the model's ability to identify positive instances.
4.  [x] **_F1 Score:_** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall.

**Confusion Matrix:**

* True Positive (TP): 95 - The number of actual positive cases correctly identified by the model.
* True Negative (TN): 26 - The number of actual negative cases correctly identified by the model.
* False Positive (FP): 12 - The number of actual negative cases incorrectly identified as positive by the model.
* False Negative (FN): 21 - The number of actual positive cases incorrectly identified as negative by the model.

##### Explanations:

2. [x] **_Precision:_** The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
3. [x] **_Recall:_** The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives. It measures the model's ability to identify positive instances.
4. [x] **_F1 Score:_** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall.


## 📈 Results

Model performance reports and evaluation metrics are saved and displayed in the `comprehensive_model_report.py` script output.

## 💡 Future Work

- Implement more advanced deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks, LSTM).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Explore feature selection techniques to improve model accuracy.
- Integrate additional health datasets for broader analysis.
